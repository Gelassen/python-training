### **Task Set for Learning pytest**

#### **1. Basic pytest Setup and Test Writing**

**Task 1: Install pytest and Write Simple Tests**
- **Objective**: Install pytest and write basic tests for simple functions.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Install pytest in a virtual environment using `pip install pytest`.
  2. Create a Python file (e.g., `calculator.py`) with basic functions like `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, `multiply(a, b)`, and `divide(a, b)`.
  3. Write a separate test file (e.g., `test_calculator.py`) to test each function.
  4. Run your tests using the `pytest` command and ensure they pass.

**Task 2: Write Tests with Assertions**
- **Objective**: Learn different assertion styles and pytest's assertion introspection.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Extend your `test_calculator.py` file to include more complex test cases (e.g., division by zero).
  2. Use various assertions like `assert`, `assertEqual`, `assertRaises` to check expected outcomes and exceptions.

#### **2. Working with pytest Fixtures**

**Task 3: Create and Use Basic Fixtures**
- **Objective**: Learn how to use pytest fixtures to set up and tear down resources.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a fixture in `conftest.py` that sets up a list of numbers and returns it.
  2. Write tests in `test_calculator.py` that use this fixture to test functions like `sum(numbers)`.

**Task 4: Parameterize Tests**
- **Objective**: Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to run tests with different input sets.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Parameterize your `test_calculator.py` tests for the `add` and `multiply` functions to run with multiple sets of inputs.
  2. Validate that your tests run multiple times with different inputs and check the results.

**Task 5: Scoped Fixtures**
- **Objective**: Understand fixture scopes (`function`, `class`, `module`, `session`).
- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a fixture with `scope='module'` that initializes a database connection (mock the actual connection).
  2. Write a set of tests that use this fixture, ensuring the database connection is initialized only once per module.

#### **3. Mocking and Patching**

**Task 6: Mock a Function**
- **Objective**: Mock a function using `unittest.mock` to isolate your tests.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a function `fetch_data_from_api(url)` in a module (e.g., `api_client.py`) that performs an HTTP GET request.
  2. Write a test that mocks this function to return a fake response instead of making an actual HTTP call.

**Task 7: Mock a Class Method**
- **Objective**: Mock a class method to control its behavior during testing.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a class `UserService` in a file (e.g., `user_service.py`) with a method `get_user_by_id(user_id)`.
  2. Write tests for `UserService` where `get_user_by_id` is mocked to return a predefined user object.
  3. Ensure the tests do not rely on any external database or API.

**Task 8: Mock External Dependencies**
- **Objective**: Use `patch()` to mock external dependencies in your tests.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Create a module `order_processor.py` with a function `process_order(order_id)` that internally calls `UserService.get_user_by_id()` and `InventoryService.check_stock()`.
  2. Write a test for `process_order()` using `patch()` to mock `get_user_by_id` and `check_stock`.
  3. Ensure your test does not depend on any external services or resources.

#### **4. Advanced pytest Features**

**Task 9: Testing Exceptions and Edge Cases**
- **Objective**: Write tests that handle exceptions and test edge cases.
- **Instructions**:

  2. Write tests that check if the correct exception is raised with the appropriate message.

**Task 10: Using pytest Plugins**
- **Objective**: Learn how to use and install pytest plugins.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Write an integration test for `process_order()` that involves multiple service calls and external dependencies.
  2. Mock all external service calls to simulate a real-world scenario.
  3. Ensure that the integration test verifies the correct interaction between components.

**Task 13: Continuous Integration with pytest**
- **Objective**: Set up continuous integration for running pytest tests.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Use GitHub Actions or another CI tool to set up a pipeline that automatically runs your pytest test suite.
  2. Ensure the pipeline runs on each commit and provides feedback on test results and code coverage.

**Task 14: Performance Testing with pytest-benchmark**
- **Objective**: Benchmark code performance using `pytest-benchmark`.
- **Instructions**:
  1. Install `pytest-benchmark` using `pip install pytest-benchmark`.

### **Mocking Tips and Tricks**

- **Always clean up**: Ensure mocks do not persist between tests to avoid unintended side effects.
- **Mock only what's necessary**: Over-mocking can lead to brittle tests that don't truly reflect the behavior of your code.
- **Use `autospec=True`**: When using `patch()`, set `autospec=True` to ensure your mocks match the signatures of the objects being mocked, reducing errors and increasing reliability.

By following this structured learning path, you will build a solid foundation in pytest and gain proficiency in mocking techniques, enabling you to write robust and maintainable tests.
