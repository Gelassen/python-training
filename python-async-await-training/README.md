Hereâ€™s a short list of tasks to help you train yourself with async/await in Python:

    Basic Async Function:
        Write a simple async function that uses await asyncio.sleep() to simulate a delay, then prints a message.

    Multiple Async Functions:
        Create several async functions that simulate different tasks (e.g., downloading a file, processing data). Use asyncio.gather() to run them concurrently.

    Async I/O:
        Write an async function to read from a file asynchronously using aiofiles.
        Write another async function to write to a file asynchronously.

    HTTP Requests:
        Use aiohttp to make asynchronous HTTP GET requests to multiple URLs concurrently and print the status of each response.

    Producer-Consumer:
        Implement a producer-consumer pattern using asyncio.Queue. The producer should generate items and put them in the queue, while the consumer takes items from the queue and processes them.

    Timeouts and Cancellation:
        Write an async function that performs a long-running task. Use asyncio.wait_for() to set a timeout for this task. Handle the asyncio.TimeoutError exception.

    Parallel Execution:
        Write an async function that performs CPU-bound operations using concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor or ThreadPoolExecutor with await loop.run_in_executor().

    Database Access:
        Use an async database client (like asyncpg for PostgreSQL) to perform asynchronous database operations such as inserting, updating, and querying records.

    Web Scraping:
        Use aiohttp and BeautifulSoup to perform asynchronous web scraping of multiple web pages concurrently.

    Error Handling:
        Write an async function that includes proper error handling with try, except, finally blocks to ensure resources are cleaned up properly after an error occurs.
